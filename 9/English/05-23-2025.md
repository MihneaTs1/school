# Proposal

**Dear festival organizers,**

The aim of this proposal is to reprezent **Team Romania** at the upcoming International Cultural Festival in London, and bring a taste of our unique culture to the world stage. Romania mixes both Eastern and Western influences in a way that's both rich in history and super engaging for an international audience.

To give visitors an authentic experience, here's what we suggest:

# Music & Dance

Live shows can be offered, featuring *Ciuleandra* and *Calusarii* - fast-paced, traditional dances full of energy and rythm. They would be performed with Romanian folk instruments such as the *pan flute*, the *violin*, and the *cimbalom*, showcasing the soul of rural Romania.

# Food Stall

Food always brings people together, and Romanian cuisine is no exception. Diverse traditional meals can be offered:

- *Sarmale* - cabbage rolls packed with meat and rice
- *Mamaliga* - polenta paired with cheese and sour cream
- *Cozonac* - sweet bread filled with nuts
- *Mici* - grilled rolls of spiced meat, best eaten with mustard and bread

# Crafts & Traditions

A stand can be put up, with painted Easter eggs, hand-made fabrics, and wood carvings - traditional crafts that show off the creativity of Romanian regions.

# Storytelling Corner

A corner for storytelling where people can hear the origin of the *Dracula* myth, learn about the Castle of Bran, and discover other cool places like the painted monasteries of Bucovina.

With music, food, art, and stories, **Team Romania** is expected to stand out and leave a strong impression at the festival.
