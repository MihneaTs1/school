# Proposal

**Dear festival organizers,**

We would like to reprezent **Team Romania** at the upcoming International Cultural Festival in London, and bring a taste of our unique culture to the world stage. Romania mixes both Eastern and Western influences in a way that's both rich in history and super engaging for an international audience.

To give visitors an authentic experience, here's what we suggest:

# Music & Dance

We can offer live shows featuring *Ciuleandra* and *Calusarii* - fast-paced, traditional dances full of energy and rythm. They would be performed with Romanian folk instruments such as the *pan flute*, the *violin*, and the *cimbalom*, showcasing the soul of rural Romania.

# Food Stall

Food always brings people together, and Romanian cuisine is no exception. We'd serve:

- *Sarmale* - cabbage rolls packed with meat and rice
- *Mamaliga* - polenta paired with cheese and sour cream
- *Cozonac* - sweet bread filled with nuts
- *Mici* - grilled rolls of spiced meat, best eaten with mustard and bread

# Crafts & Traditions

We would put up a stand with painted Easter eggs, hand-made fabrics, and wood carvings - traditional crafts that show off the creativity of Romanian regions.

# Stories & Legends

A corner for storytelling where people can hear the origin of the *Dracula* myth, learn about the Castle of Bran, and discover other cool places like the painted monasteries of Bucovina.

With music, food, art, and stories, we're confident Romania will stand out and leave a strong impression at the festival.
