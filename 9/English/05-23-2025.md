# Proposal for Representing Romanian Culture at the International Cultural Festival in London

**Dear Festival Organizer,**

We’d love to represent **Romania** at the upcoming International Cultural Festival in London and bring a taste of our unique culture to the world stage. Romania blends Eastern and Western influences in a way that’s both rich in history and super engaging for an international audience.

To give visitors an authentic experience, here’s what we suggest:

### Music & Dance

Live shows featuring *Ciuleandra* and *Călușarii* — traditional dances that are full of energy and rhythm. They’d be performed with Romanian folk instruments like the *pan flute*, *violin*, and *cimbalom*, showcasing the soul of rural Romania.

### Food Stall

Food always brings people together, and Romanian cuisine is no exception. We’d serve:

* *Sarmale* – cabbage rolls packed with meat and rice
* *Mămăligă* – our version of polenta, paired with cheese and sour cream
* *Cozonac* – a sweet, nutty holiday bread
* *Mici* – grilled rolls of spiced meat, best eaten with mustard and bread

It’s cozy, flavorful, and full of surprises.

### Crafts & Traditions

We’d put up a stand with painted Easter eggs, hand-woven fabrics, and wood carvings — traditional crafts that show off the creativity and diversity of Romanian regions.

### Stories & Legends

A corner for storytelling where people can hear the origin of the *Dracula* myth, learn about Bran Castle, and discover other cool places like the painted monasteries of Bucovina.

With music, food, art, and stories, we’re confident Romania will stand out and leave a strong impression at the festival.

**All the best,**
*Team Romania*
