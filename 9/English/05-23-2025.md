# Proposal for Representing Romanian Culture at the International Cultural Festival in London

**Dear Festival Organizer,**

We propose showcasing **Romania** at the upcoming International Cultural Festival in London. Romania’s unique mix of Eastern and Western European influences makes it a fascinating culture to share with the world.

To create an engaging and authentic experience, we recommend the following elements:

### 🎶 Traditional Music & Dance  
Live performances of *Ciuleandra* and *Călușarii* — iconic Romanian dances — accompanied by instruments such as the *pan flute*, *violin*, and *cimbalom*. These dances are energetic and symbolic, reflecting Romanian rural life and community.

### 🍲 Culinary Experience  
A food stall offering popular dishes like:
- *Sarmale* (cabbage rolls filled with minced meat and rice)  
- *Mămăligă* (Romanian polenta, often served with cheese and sour cream)  
- *Cozonac* (sweet bread filled with walnuts or cocoa)
- *Mici* (grilled minced beef and mutton, often accompanied by mustard)  

Romanian food is hearty and flavorful, often surprising visitors with its depth and fusion of Balkan, Turkish, and Austro-Hungarian influences.

### 🎨 Arts & Crafts  
A display of hand-painted Easter eggs, traditional embroidery, and carved wooden items. These crafts are part of Romania’s heritage, passed down through generations and representing different regions of the country.

### 🧛 Storytelling Corner  
A booth sharing Romanian myths, including the famous Dracula legend from Transylvania, alongside facts about historical sites like Bran Castle and the painted monasteries of Bucovina.

We believe this mix of music, food, art, and folklore would leave a lasting impression on festivalgoers and reflect the true spirit of Romanian culture.

**Sincerely,**  
*Team Romania*
