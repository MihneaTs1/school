### Q: You wake up one morning with a superpower â€“ what is it and how do you use it?

One morning, I woke up feeling energized and stepped outside, amazed to find I could fly! At first, I was thrilled just soaring through the sky, but soon realized my new ability could help others. I quickly started delivering crucial medical supplies and food to areas hit by natural disasters, reaching places blocked by damaged roads. In crowded cities, I rescued people trapped by fires or earthquakes in tall buildings faster than emergency services. I also began watching over wildlife habitats from above, reporting illegal activities like poaching or logging to authorities. Beyond practical help, flying visibly above communities inspired hope, reminding everyone that we can support and uplift each other in meaningful ways.
