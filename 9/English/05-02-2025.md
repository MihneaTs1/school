### Q: You wake up one morning with a superpower â€“ what is it and how do you use it?

One morning, I wake up buzzing with energy, step outside, and discover I can fly! Initially exhilarated, I quickly understand this power can do much good. I rush to deliver essential medical supplies and food to disaster-struck regions, reaching victims when roads are blocked. In cities, I rescue people from fires or earthquakes in high-rise buildings faster than any traditional rescue method. From the skies, I also patrol vulnerable wildlife habitats, swiftly reporting poaching or illegal logging. Beyond these practical efforts, my visible presence soaring above inspires hope, reminding everyone that we can all uplift others, even without literal wings.
