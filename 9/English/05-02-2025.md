### Q: You wake up one morning with a superpower â€“ what is it and how do you use it?

One morning, I woke up feeling energized, like something was different. I stepped outside to stretch, only to find myself floating! It took a second to click, I was flying! At first, panic hit me, for example, what if I floated into space? But soon, excitement took over. I zoomed around my neighborhood, vibing through clouds and waving to stunned neighbors below. Seeing a traffic jam, I swooped down and effortlessly guided cars around the blockage. It felt awesome using my new ability to help out. From that day on, I knew life wouldn't be the same - I'd always look at problems from a higher perspective.
